# basic_chatbot
The purpose of this program is to explore coding techniques in pure C++ to build a basic chat bot.  The goal is to study C++ alternatives to advanced coding techniques such as regular expressions.  Please note: This is an early alpha version, so it is simplified, in the hopes of being useful for learning the fundamentals.  Learning on an advanced system may take a few years.

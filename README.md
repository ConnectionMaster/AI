# Artificial Intelligence fundamentals
The purpose of this program is to explore coding techniques in coding to build a basic artificial intelligence.  The goal is to study alternatives to advanced coding techniques.  Please note: This is still prototypical, so it is simplified, in the hopes of being useful for learning A.I. fundamentals.  Learning on an advanced system may take a few years.
